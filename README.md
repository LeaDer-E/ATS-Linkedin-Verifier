# ATS-Linkedin-Verifier
This tool is designed to be run periodically to verify LinkedIn profile links extracted from ATS-style CVs (DOCX files). If a candidate updates or changes their LinkedIn URL, the system detects this change so that their resume can be updated accordingly after the client sends us the new link.
